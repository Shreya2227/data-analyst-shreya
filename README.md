Objective:
The main objective of the project is to organize, clean and unify data from various other sources for creating a reliable, well-structured dataset. This will help to improve the analysis of consumers and relevant information to guide advertising techniques and enhance the informed choices will become possible with this dataset. 

Background:
Organization collects customer data from numerous channels like sales transaction, customer service interaction, and campaign for marketing. Whereas, this data is incomplete, fragmented, and inconsistent which makes it a challenge for deriving useful insights. The main focus of this project is to address these data issues through effective data wrangling techniques.

Dataset:

Sales data- Transaction records which includes timestamps, product description, purchase amount, and customer ID.

Customer information- The customer's demographic information, including age, gender, location and the date of account creation. 

Customer service records- These are the logs of customers complaints, questions and answers from consumers.

Marketing interaction details- Campaign and email response data, such as click through and open rates. 

Methodology:

Data collection- For data collection, it is important to ensure that the data is collected from various sources like CRM system, databases and third party marketing platforms. It is essential to ensure that customer-related dataset is recognized for building a comprehensive customer profile. 

Data assessment- For finding a problems like duplication, missing values, and variation among datasets, will perform a rough assessment of the data qualtiy. Document data types and formats. 

Data cleaning- Applying the proper technique for data cleaning. Handling the data properly by adding missing values in the dataset in accordance with their importance and context. Removing any duplicate records for dataset (especially in customer service logs or transaction date). Normalizing categorical variables like standardising the status of consumers for ensuring consistent terminology.

Data transformation- For this step, it is vital to make sure that all the fields for dataset are appropriate for analysis and converting data types where it is necessary. Creating new features which includes frequency of purchases, and purchase amount. For the data to be aggregate, make sure that it fits to the planned analysis.

Data consolidation- Creating a single consumer database for merging datasets. Also, creating an accurate understanding of each individual by combining marketing, sales, and support data.

Documentation and Validation- Recording the overall process of data wrangling including transformation of dataset, cleaning techniques, and data sources. For the accuracy, completeness, and ready to use this data we should examine the final set of information of this dataset by using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Tools and Technologies:

For this dataset, we used AWS Glue Databrew but we can also use Python (Pandas and NumPy) or R for the cleaning and manipulation. SQL used for the relational database for the gathering of information and initial analysis. For visual data wrangling and documentation, using RStudio or Jupyter Notebook. Tools that are used for visualisation such as (Seaborn and Matplotlib) for supporting quality checks and EDA. 

Deliverables:

The dataset which is ready, cleaned, and transformed. It is also available in a suitable format (like Excel database or CSV file) and the rigorous report for the challenges faced, techniques used, and the overall features of the dataset used in the process of data wrangling. Visual representation of the primary data results and verification of the process data quality checks.

Timeline:

It took us around 3 hours to complete the project with AWS Glue Databrew which includes assessing, cleaning, transformatio, and documentation. The aim of this project is to establish a high-quality dataset for conducting a effective customer analytics, increasing strategies for marketing, enhancing customer service, and maintaining overall business growth. 

Conclusion:

This data wrangling process is essential for building a high quality and consistency of activity data where the customer analysis of the company will be based. It provides better understanding of the target marketing, satisfaction of customers, and better decision-making which will help the firm for enhancing the growth.
